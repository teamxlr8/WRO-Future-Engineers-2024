This repository is for the first test we ran on our robot. This code is for a simple wall follower robot, in which we have used utrasonic sensors to detect the distance between the outer and inner walls. According to the difference in the distance between the left and right ultrasonic sensors, the robot attempts to stay in the middle of the arena as much as possible.
