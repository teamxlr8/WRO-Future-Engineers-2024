This repository is for the initial test we ran on the Pixy Cam. First, we worked on downloading the Pixy Cam library on Arduino such that we could ensure that the two are compatible with each other. On doing so, we then proceeded to test the example code already available on Arduino. This was a simple test to ensure the connections were successful. After that, we started working on the most important part; which was to test whether or not the Pixy Cam was able to correctly detect colours, and transfer this information effectively to Arduino. To do so, we created a simple code in which we added a simple if-else logic. Using the same, we were able to make a LED/buzzer turn on for a long time when the first signature was detected-in other words, when red was detected for example- and we made the LED/buzzer blink when the second signature was detected, or when green was detected.
