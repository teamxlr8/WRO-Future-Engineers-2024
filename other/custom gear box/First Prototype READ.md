This repository is for the custom gear box that we made for our robot. Initially, we were using the Rev Core Hex robot in our first prototype. The Rev Core Hex motor ran at a 125 rpm and weighed 200 grams. However, eventually we realised that this motor was functioning at a really slow speed. Even though this motor had a good torque but it was heavy, it had a very low rmp. Therefore, we weren't able to perform the task in an efficient manner with this motor. So, we tried to change the motor by using N20 motor which ran at 200 rpm and weighed 10 grams. This motor was light and had a high speed, but didn't have enough torque, so it wasn't a viable option either. Therefore, we finally decided to use the Bag motor which weighed 325 grams. For that, we needed to make a custom gear box, which has a 4:15 reduction (16:60). The pinion on the moitor runs at a 13,180 rpm which is powered by a Bag motor. This Bag motor is a VEX motor is a 13,180 rpm motor with 0.4 N-m stall torque. The 60 tooth gear connected to the output shaft by reduction gives a motor speed to 3,514 rpm. The reason that we have chosen to make the custom gear box is because we want to use a better motor.
