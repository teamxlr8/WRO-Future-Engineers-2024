In our last iteration of the gear box, we were using readily available pinion gears and had attached those two together based on the CAD file we had created. However, when we actually made those changes on a box channel and then cut it and tested it, we realised that the two pinions were not compatible with each other. Due to this, there a slipping issue we weren't able to solve. The only way around this that we saw was creating our own custom pinion gear and then changing the gear box accordingly. So we did exactly that. Based on the new pinion, we altered the CAD file, after which we made a bigger and clearer drawing of the same on paper to clearly understand the intricate measurements. Based on these measurements, we created a new customised gear box in a C shape, and we are now going to test it.
