This repository includes the second test we ran on our robot. In this code, we have added and made progress on the previous line following code. Here, we've used a NavX magnetometer, in which we have tried to limit the number of turns out line following robot takes based on the values detected and stored by the Nav X sensor. In a later repository we will add more information on the sensor we have used and how we are implementing the sensor's values.
