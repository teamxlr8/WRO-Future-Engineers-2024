We are using the NavX magnetometer in our robot in order to be able to measure and control the number of times the car circles around the inner boundary. Traditionally, the NavX magnetometer is a sensor commonly used in robotics and navigation applications to measure magnetic fields and determine orientation relative to the Earth's magnetic field. The core component of the NavX magnetometer is a 3-axis magnetometer, which measures the magnetic field strength along three perpendicular axes (X, Y, and Z). These measurements are often also refered to as roll, pitch and yaw respectively. We have explained these parameters in more detail below.

Moreover, the NavX sensor typically includes a microcontroller that processes the raw data from the magnetometer. The NavX magnetometer typically provides various interfaces for integration with robotics platforms, such as I2C, SPI, or UART. This makes it compatible with many microcontrollers and development boards. We have integrated the NavX with the Arduino Uno Board for this project.

Additionally, when combined with other sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes, the NavX magnetometer can provide more accurate orientation and heading information through sensor fusion algorithms. These algorithms combine data from multiple sensors to reduce errors and noise. Also, to ensure accurate readings, the NavX magnetometer often requires calibration. This process involves moving the sensor through various orientations to map out and correct any magnetic distortions caused by nearby objects. For instance, the NavX magnetometer is used to help robots determine their heading and maintain a stable direction of travel. In automotive applications, the magnetometer can be used for electronic compasses and navigation systems. In our robot, we are using the NavX magnetometer to measure and account for turns taken. So, in each circle, the magnetometer should measure four turns, and should take three such circles with twelve total turns. We are integrating the NavX sensor with the Arduino board to be able to stop the robot when it does this.

Now, explaining the roll, pitch and yaw parameters… Yaw, pitch, and roll are three rotational degrees of freedom that describe the orientation of an object in 3D space. In the context of the NavX sensor, these terms refer to the angular orientation of a device, typically a robot or UAV, relative to its own coordinate system.

Roll is the rotation around the longitudinal axis (X-axis). It represents the tilt of the object from side to side. The NavX sensor measures roll using the accelerometer and gyroscope. The accelerometer detects the force of gravity to determine side-to-side tilt, while the gyroscope measures rotational changes around the longitudinal axis. Roll is essential for balance and stability. In a robot, the roll angle helps maintain equilibrium on uneven surfaces, while in a drone, it helps control the side-to-side tilt.

Pitch is the rotation around the lateral axis (Y-axis). It represents the tilt of the object forward or backward. The NavX sensor measures pitch using the accelerometer and gyroscope. The accelerometer detects the force of gravity, which indicates the tilt angle, while the gyroscope measures rotational changes around the lateral axis. Pitch is important for maintaining stability and orientation. For instance, in a drone, the pitch angle helps control the forward or backward tilt during flight.

Lastly, yaw is the rotation around the vertical axis (Z-axis). It represents the direction the object is facing horizontally, often referred to as the heading. In the NavX sensor, yaw is measured using the magnetometer and gyroscope. The magnetometer detects the direction of the Earth's magnetic field to determine heading, while the gyroscope measures rotational changes around the vertical axis. Yaw is crucial for navigation. For example, in a robot, the yaw angle helps determine the direction the robot is moving or facing.

The NavX sensor combines data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer to provide accurate measurements of yaw, pitch, and roll. This process, known as sensor fusion, involves filtering, calibration and fusion algorithms. Filtering is when raw data from each sensor is filtered to remove noise and improve accuracy. Then, sensors are calibrated to compensate for any biases or distortions. And lastly, advanced algorithms combine the data from all sensors to provide a stable and accurate estimate of the device's orientation.

While roll, pitch and yaw are all three equally important in understanding and manipulating the orientation of a robot, we will be focusing on the yaw value, since we just need to alter the robot’s ability to turn left or right, by adjusting its heading.
