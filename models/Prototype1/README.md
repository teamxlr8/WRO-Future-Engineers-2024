This repository consists of the CAD file of our robot's first prototype. We have tried to replicate the same robot in person when working on our robot, with a few minor changes that we made as we saw fit. This robot has a forward steering Ackerman mechanism powered by a servo motor, with a Rev Core Hex double-shaft motor driving the vehicle. We have added three ultrasonic sensors for the distance measurement, one in the front-middle of the robot, and two at 45 degrees on the left and right of the front of the robot.
