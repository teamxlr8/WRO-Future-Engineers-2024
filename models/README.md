This folder holds the .step file for the final assembly of our robot, as well as photos of what it should look like. The .step file will help the viewer look into each part of the robot chassis and electricals, and it can make it easier to follow the tutorial using the timeline feature on Fusion 360. 

Since the .step file is too large to upload, we're adding a google drive link with the file uploaded on that: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iC6DVvbiXgJcQIvjXP-3EXG4zTWpt-ap?usp=sharing
